# Use Cases:

The evolving graph generator is driven by a user configuration that describes the static and dynamic properties of the evolving graph.

As shown in the figure above, we need to indicate the static graph configuration that is the input of **gMark**, and the evolving graph configuration that is the input of **EGG**.

During conception and developpement of EGG, we worked with the use-case Trip, which is a geographical database that match cities and hotels.

The trip use case includes almost all evolution characteristics that EGG can handle. In the repository use-case of [trip](https://github.com/karimalami7/EGG/tree/master/use_cases/trip), We have put in README details of this characteristics.
