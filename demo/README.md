# Demo

For each use case X, we have two directories:

* X/: where we put an example of script to run **gMark** and **EGG** with the use case X.
* X_output/: where we put examples of outputs of **gMark** and **EGG** such as RDF output encoded in [TriG](https://www.w3.org/TR/trig/) format, version graph output, accuracy plots.

We additionally have two other directories:

* *Scalability*: where we put scripts to evaluate the scalability of EGG. More information about this demonstration scenario is available in the [EGG scalability wiki](https://github.com/karimalami7/EGG/wiki/Scalability).

* *System evaluation*: where we put scripts to evaluate two approaches for historical reachability queries on top of **EGG** output. More information about such demonstration scenario is available in the [system evaluation wiki](https://github.com/karimalami7/EGG/wiki/System-Evaluation:-Historical-Reachability-Queries).
