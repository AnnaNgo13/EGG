# Use Cases

In this directory, we present five use cases.
Each of them consists of a static graph configuration (encoded as **gMark** configuration file) and an evolving graph configuration (encoded as an **EGG** configuration file).
As illustrated in the figure below, **EGG** takes as input a graph generated by **gMark** and an evolving graph configuration.

Our running example is the use case Trip, which is a geographical database storing information about cities and hotels. 
The Trip use case includes examples of the very diverse evolution constraints that we support in **EGG**.
We develop this use case in its dedicated [readme](https://github.com/karimalami7/EGG/tree/master/use_cases/trip).

We defined also four other use cases:

* *dblp*: stores nodes of type author and edges of type co-author. The edges have an evolving property *number of publications*, which store the number of publications between two authors in a given year. 

* *social*: stores persons as nodes, and friendship relation as edges.

* *univ*: stores universities, professors, students and courses. Inspired from lubm benchmark.

* *shop*: stores shops, products and offers. Inspired from watdiv.
