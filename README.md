# EGG

An open-source project for generating evolving graphs.

The generation is driven by finely tuned constraint and parameters. It uses ![gMark](https://github.com/karimalami7/gmark/tree/gmark_for_egg) to generate static graphs.

To begin working with EGG, please run the ![requirement](https://github.com/karimalami7/EGG/blob/master/demo/scripts/requirement.sh) script, it checks and installs all software needed to run EGG.

Then feel free to modify gMark schema and EGG configuration in ![play](https://github.com/karimalami7/EGG/tree/master/use_cases/play) scenario.
