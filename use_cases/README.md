# Use Cases

In this directory, we present five use cases.
Each of them consists of a static graph configuration (encoded as **gMark** configuration file) and an evolving graph configuration (encoded as an **EGG** configuration file).
As illustrated in the figure below, **EGG** takes as input a graph generated by **gMark** and an evolving graph configuration.

Our running example is the use case **trip**, which is a geographical database storing information about cities and hotels. 
The **trip** use case includes examples of the very diverse evolution constraints that we support in **EGG**.
We develop this use case in its dedicated [readme](https://github.com/karimalami7/EGG/tree/master/use_cases/trip).

We also defined four other use cases:

* **dblp**: stores nodes of type author and edges of type co-author. The edges have an evolving property *number of publications*, which stores the number of publications between two authors in a given year. 
More information about this use case in its dedicated [readme](https://github.com/karimalami7/EGG/tree/master/use_cases/dblp).

* **social**: stores persons as nodes, and friendship relation as edges.
More information about this use case in its dedicated [readme](https://github.com/karimalami7/EGG/tree/master/use_cases/social).

* **univ**: stores the relation between students, professors, courses, and universities.
We were inspired by the LUBM benchmark, while focusing only on the classes susceptible to have evolving properties. 
More information about this use case in its dedicated [readme](https://github.com/karimalami7/EGG/tree/master/use_cases/univ).

* **shop**: stores the relation between offers and products in an online shop.
We were inspired by the WatDiv benchmark, while focusing only on the classes susceptible to have evolving properties. 
More information about this usecase in its dedicated [readme](https://github.com/karimalami7/EGG/tree/master/use_cases/shop).
